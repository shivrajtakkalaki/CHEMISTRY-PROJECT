        <h2>What is Corrosion?</h2>
        <img src="corrosion.jpg" class="photo">

        <p>
            Metal corrosion is the gradual destruction of a metal due to a chemical or electrochemical reaction with its environment, such as oxygen and moisture.
             This process converts the metal into a more stable compound, like an oxide, and results in the deterioration of the metal's properties and strength.
             A common example is the rusting of iron. 
             Corrosion is a natural process that converts a refined metal into a more chemically stable oxide.
              It is the gradual deterioration of materials (usually a metal) by chemical or electrochemical reaction with their environment.
              Corrosion engineering is the field dedicated to controlling and preventing corrosion.

        <h2>Types of Corrosion</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1.Uniform Corrosion</li>
            <li>2.Pitting Corrosion</li>
            <li>3.Galvanic Corrosion</li>
            <li>4.Crevice Corrosion</li>
            
        </ul>

        <img src="types corrosion.jpg" class="photo ">
        <p>1.Uniform Corrosion - 
                Corrosion that spreads evenly over the entire surface of the metal.
             It reduces the metal thickness uniformly and is the most common and predictable type.</p>
             <img src="uniform corrosion.jpg" class="photo ">
        <p>2. Pitting Corrosion-

             A highly localized corrosion that forms small holes or pits on the metal surface.</p>
            <img src="pitting corrosion.jpeg" class="photo "> 
        <p>3. Galvanic Corrosion-

             Corrosion that occurs when two different metals are in electrical contact in the presence of an electrolyte (like water).
             The more reactive metal corrodes faster.</p>
             <img src="galvani corrosion.jpeg" class="photo "> 
        <p>4. Crevice Corrosion-

             Corrosion that happens in tight, narrow spaces where oxygen cannot reach (like under gaskets, bolts, or deposits).
             The lack of oxygen accelerates corrosion inside the crevice.</p>
